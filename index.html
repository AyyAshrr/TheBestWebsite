<p>
    At its core scrum is about continuous learning and adjusting to change

It acknowledges that we don't know everything at the start of a project, and it's structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing market conditions and user requirements.

<h3>How scrum works</h3>
<p>
    Scrum revolves around short, iterative release cycles, or sprints, that allow you to ship often, reprioritize when needed, and constantly improve.

<h3>The Scrum Framework</h3>
<p>Scrum is simple.  It is the opposite of a big collection of interwoven mandatory components. Scrum is not a methodology. Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems.  The below graphic represents Scrum in Action as described by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland in their book Software in 30 Days taking us from planning through software delivery.
